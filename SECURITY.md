# Disclosing security vulnerabilities

Please disclose security vulnerabilities responsively. E-Mail the head maintainer (`portasynthinca3 (at) gmail.com` at the time) with regards to such vulnerabilities. You should expect a response within 48 hours. If they do not reply within a week, feel free to disclose your findings publicly, though you shall demonstrate them in a way that does not violate the Terms of Service.

They will receive your report and do their best to mitigate the vulnerability. Feel free to disclose it on your own two weeks after the patch has been released as a part of a new client version if it's client-related, or immediately after them informing you if it's backend-related. Thank you.
