# Yamka Privacy Policy

## Introduction

## Updates to this document
Yamka reserves the right to update this Policy, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to our Platform. If the changes affect your usage of Yamka and/or your legal rights, we’ll notify you no less than seven days before the changes take effect. Unless stated otherwise, your continued use of the Service after said modifications take effect will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to those changes. If you object to the changes, your recourse shall be to cease using the Service.

Changes will take effect on: **May 29th 2020**

## Information you provide to us
#### Profile and account information
We store profile and account information you explicitly provide to us includingб but not limited to:
  - your username;
  - your profile picture;
  - your email address;
  - other explicitly provided data.

You are free to get and set this data in client software.
#### Messages
We store messages and associated data in order to provide the service. Direct messages, i.e. ones sent between two users and not in the context of a group, are end-to-end encrypted.

## Information we disclose to third parties
We may share some information with third parties. For example, we may send you E-Mail that passes through a number of 3rd parties, and thus is subject to their Privacy Policies. They are legally and/or contractually obligated to keep such data safe. We share as little data as possible, only for essential "no-surprise" purposes.

## Requesting your information
Please contact our support team via E-Mail (`support (at) yamka.app` at the time) to request your data package.
