We store profile and account information you explicitly provide to us including but not limited to: username, E-Mail and avatar. You are free to get and set this data in client software.
#### Messages
We store messages and associated data in order to provide the service. Some messages will be end-to-end encrypted in the future, meaning we can't have access to them, cryptographically.

## Information we disclose to third parties
